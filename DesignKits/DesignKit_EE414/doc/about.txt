Description: Design kit containing component models and artwork to be used in EE414/514
Revision History: 

Rev. 1.2
-----------
11/4/2021 -- Fixed typo in DRC file and updated version to v1.24

11/4/2021 -- Fixed incorrect layer mapping in substrate definitions and updated the version to v1.23

10/18/2021 -- Added DRC rules for Advanced Circuits 2-layer process and updated the version to v1.22

10/14/2021 -- The following changes were made:
   -- Updated the names of the pad and pad-with-via cells.
   -- Created footprint layout for the edge-mount SMA connector.
   -- Created footprint layout for the TLC2201 opamp.

10/12/2021 -- The following changes were made:
   -- Added TLC2201 10V model to the EE414 palette and the TLC2201 5V model to the EE514 palette.
   -- Added a file for defining global variabls for the parameterized artwork
   -- Added layout component for in-pad via with solder mask

10/11/2021 -- Added a Pad component to the layout palette that includes both copper and solder mask layers.

10/8/2021 -- The following changes were made:
   -- Added artwork to all resistors, inductors, capacitors, and transistors. The artwork is drawn on the default layer
    and represents the size of the components for use during layout. Also added two pallets to the Layout view to accomodate this.
   -- Changed the layer numbers to start at 0 instead of 1. This allows for the correct instancing of other ADS components.
   -- Updated res_0603.net and res_1206.net so that each parasitic series inductor has a value that is 1/2 of the value
      defined in the parasitic_param_values.txt file. Comments in the parasitic_param_values.txt file were updated accordingly.

Rev. 1.1
-----------
9/8/2021 -- Split the palette into two different palettes. One for 414 students with only 1206 components (and 0603 inductor) and the BFR182 
transistor, and one for 514 students with only 0603 components and the BFP620 transistor.

9/8/2021 -- Removed Rp and Cblock from the 1206 and 0603 capacitor model files. These components were not required in the actual
modeling because Rp was on the order of 10's of kOhm. Also removed the parameters for these two components from the parasitic_param_values.txt file.

8/25/2021 -- Fixed the itemdef.ael file for the BFR620 S-parameter model to use the correct path for including the *.net file that
that ADS doesn't think that the model is being double declared.
