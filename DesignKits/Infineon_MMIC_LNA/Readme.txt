Please note that the Infineon Component Library has the same folder names, independent on the library version.
Therefore your current Infineon libraries may be overwritten when installing a newer one. Please rename your
current ADS library folder for your own records or contact the Infineon Customer Support
for older versions of your library. If using the new library with an older design make
sure to add the new library to your workspace.
