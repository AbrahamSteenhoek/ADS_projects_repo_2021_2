    Data in the Touchstone file `D:/ee_514/designkits/designkit_ee414/circuit/data/BFP620_w_noise_VCE_2.0V_IC_40mA.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Noise data in the Touchstone file `D:/ee_514/designkits/designkit_ee414/circuit/data/BFP620_w_noise_VCE_2.0V_IC_40mA.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.
