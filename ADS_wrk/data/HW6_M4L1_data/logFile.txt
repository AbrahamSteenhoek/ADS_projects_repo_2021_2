SP SP1[1] <EE_514_Labs_lib:HW6_M4L1:schematic>   freq=(30 MHz->12 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The DC (0 Hz) value has not been specified in the Touchstone file
    'C:/users/abrah/onedrive/documents/ee514/ads/designkits/designkit_ee414/circuit/data/BFP620_w_noise_VCE_1.5V_IC_80mA.s2p'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/users/abrah/onedrive/documents/ee514/ads/designkits/designkit_ee414/circuit/data/BFP620_w_noise_VCE_1.5V_IC_80mA.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.

    Noise data in the Touchstone file `C:/users/abrah/onedrive/documents/ee514/ads/designkits/designkit_ee414/circuit/data/BFP620_w_noise_VCE_1.5V_IC_80mA.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.
